### **Introduction**



Population growth is the increase in the number of humans on Earth. For most of human history our population size was relatively stable. But with innovation and industrialization, energy, food, water, and medical care became more available and reliable. Consequently, global human population rapidly increased, and continues to do so, with dramatic impacts on global climate and ecosystems. Human overpopulation is one of the biggest causes of the depletion of natural resources. The world population has increased from 1 Billion in 1800 to 7.7 Billion in 2020. The global population is increasing. More people means more requirement and thus more usage of resources. At the current growth rate, it is expected that the global population will reach about 11 Billion until 2100.

Every time we use any natural resource, the Earth needs time to regenerate and replenish. But now we are using resources at speed faster than Earth can restore it. So, we are experiencing a shortage of funds. Did you know that about 700 million people in the world live in extreme poverty. Overpopulation is one of the root causes of environmental issues like climate change. More people not only means more need for resources but more carbon emission too. With so many people using natural resources, carbon emissions are skyrocketing. Climate change is accelerating, and the population is a significant reason why.
