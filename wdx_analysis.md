## **Topic - "POPULATION GROWTH AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT"**



Population growth is the increase in the number of humans on Earth. For most of human history our population size was relatively stable. But with innovation and industrialization, energy, food, water, and medical care became more available and reliable. Consequently, global human population rapidly increased, and continues to do so, with dramatic impacts on global climate and ecosystems. We will need technological and social innovation to help us support the worldâ€™s population as we adapt to and mitigate climate and environmental changes.
